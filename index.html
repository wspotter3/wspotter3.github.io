<h4>About Me</h4>
	<p>
    
    I am currently a senior at Towson University located in Towson, Maryland. I am on course to graduate with a BA in Illustration in the spring of 2015. My style of art is very unique in that it is easily distinguishable from other illustrators. I have a fun creative way of designing characters, landscapes, and ideas. I can work through multiple mediums, with my preference being digital. I am very versatile and have a  vast knowledge with adobe products which gives me an edge when doing graphic design or illustration. </p>
    
    
    <h5> The Website I chose is http://johnkavanagh.co.uk/ </h5>
    
    <p2> I chose this website because of the clean look and interactivity it presented. I liked how his header would change every few seconds and it would type a new one once it erased the one before. I also enjoyed the small design details in how the home page and portfolio were formatted. </p2>
